# Leafnode

1. Copy the `app.example` and rename it to `app.env`, Copy the `db.example` and rename it to `db.env` 
2. Update the environment files with your relevant tokens and values
3. Look at the `docker-compose.yml` to make sure the values are good
4. Make sure docker-compose is running (assuming its installed)
5. Run the command `docker-compose build`
5. Run the command `docker-compose up -d`

## Note
A lot of the app does not have tests as things are a POC but still working and managed to prove what an idea but and usable as a MVP.

If there is an issue running with the docker, I recommend having the postgres db start and stop the app, then run the app locally to point to the running container DB instance. This would mean changing the `app.env` and change the line `DB_HOSTNAME` to be `localhost` and `PORT` to be what ever the exposed port on the docker postgress instance.

## Road to MVP (update with basic features list once mvp is released) ðŸŽ‰

This is a list that is relevant from the date of 27th June 2024 serviing as a baseline for a todo list for a basic test release.

- [x] GPT Input process setting
- [x] Log updates to have references or IDs displayed
- [x] Process setting (enable/disable - async/sync) - always async for now
- [x] Update output to caller to contain process result or reference to log id for data responses
- [x] String interpolation for inputs (abilit to use dynamic inputs and hard coded values as part of data to send)
- [x] Get Ngrok and project running on Raspberry PI for testing
- [x] Add "template" tag to the relevant fields that support it
- [x] Basic website
- [ ] Data encryption
- [ ] Node Types (API / Extension). The Extension uses the nodes associated
- [ ] Lock nodes from deletion
- [x] Bug with creating a new user and extension token render on dashboard

This will be the main steps that will then require assessing and looking at case studies in order to show how it will work or usages and planning for other integrations and updating the current ones to use more rich text and markup for bodies of some of the integrations.
